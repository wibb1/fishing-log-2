# README
When the fisherman has time, after taking care of the honey-do-list that is always waiting after a day on the water, they can enter the date and some simple descriptive information then walk away.  When they complete their entry the information for the trip will be entered and the API requests for the weather, tides and moon data will be gathered with no effort.  Not only that but past information that you might have around but that doesn’t have all the weather data can be entered and the information updated with all the weather data that is available (not all information is available for all past dates due to sunsetting certain information).
More importantly this data can then be used to develop a searchable database that gives insight as to why a particular trip was a good or bad and whether your next trip is going to be a good or bad day too.  Not that I am saying that a bad day on the water doesn’t beat anything else we could do, but, what I would say is, if Saturday looks better than Sunday, asking for the better day is a better bet.  A good logbook is a great tool that can help you predict if the conditions are right to have a great day fishing, the rest is up to you!
